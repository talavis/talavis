Currently a system developer and system administrator at SciLifeLab Data Centre.

I have a master degree in Biomedicine and a PhD focusing on structural bioinformatics from Karolinska Institutet. Mostly self-taught when it comes to computer-related topics.

My publications are listed at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nafzIpQAAAAJ).

Coding mainly in Python 3, but has a tendency towards testing a lot of other languages and frameworks.

Some of my current work:
* Development of a system for tracking data generated at SciLifeLab ([code](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/Data-Tracker))
* Responsible for a Kubernetes cluster (with multiple hosted services, e.g. Data Stewardship Wizard, Nextcloud, Vaultvarden) for SciLifeLab Data Centre
* Some work on the [Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.se/)
* Development and maintenance of [SweFreq](https://swefreq.nbis.se/)
* [Lunch menu aggregator](https://menu.dckube.scilifelab.se/) for restaurants at SciLifeLab Solna and Uppsala
* [Form Manager](https://forms.dckube.scilifelab.se/) is a simple system for receiving web form submissions
