Currently a system developer and system administrator at SciLifeLab Data Centre.

I have a master degree in Biomedicine and a PhD focusing on structural bioinformatics from Karolinska Institutet. Mostly self-taught when it comes to computer-related topics.

My publications are listed at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nafzIpQAAAAJ).

I'm mostly coding in Python 3, but I have a tendency towards testing a lot of other languages and frameworks.
